  abstract = 	 {We study the problem of robustly estimating the parameter $p$ of an Erdős-Rényi random graph on $n$ nodes, where a $\gamma$ fraction of nodes may be adversarially corrupted. After showing the deficiencies of canonical estimators, we design a computationally-efficient spectral algorithm which estimates $p$ up to accuracy $\tilde O(\sqrt{p(1-p)}/n + \gamma\sqrt{p(1-p)} /\sqrt{n}+ \gamma/n)$ for $\gamma &lt; 1/60$. Furthermore, we give an inefficient algorithm with similar accuracy for all $\gamma&lt;1/2$, the information-theoretic limit. Finally, we prove a nearly-matching statistical lower bound, showing that the error of our algorithms is optimal up to logarithmic factors.}

  abstract = {A stochastic model is proposed for social networks in which the actors in a network are partitioned into subgroups called blocks. The model provides a stochastic generalization of the blockmodel. Estimation techniques are developed for the special case of a single relation social network, with blocks specified a priori. An extension of the model allows for tendencies toward reciprocation of ties beyond those explained by the partition. The extended model provides a one degree-of-freedom test of the model. A numerical example from the social network literature is used to illustrate the methods.}
